# 7DTD map zones

Mode: Operate. Extend the existing Aurum map, not its visual identity. Admins draw two opposite corners or enter coordinates, edit a zone in place and explicitly save. Map tiles/panning and existing POI/claim selections stay intact. View-only users cannot mutate zones.

## Direction contract

THESIS: The map is the editor; selecting a rectangle opens its settings without an extra page or modal.

OWN-WORLD: Preserve existing dark surfaces, violet controls, Inter, border tokens and compact native form controls. No new asset or visual system.

STORY: Open zones, add a rectangle with two clicks, inspect separate PvP/damage/creature settings, save and see the success acknowledgment. Despawn is distinct from spawn prevention and has an irreversible-action warning.

FIRST VIEWPORT: Add one Zones control alongside existing map tools. Keep the map sizing unchanged. A compact editor below it groups identity, protection, creatures and messages, with save/close/delete at the end. Mobile stacks the form groups and keeps coordinate fields in two columns, without page overflow.

FORM: Precisely specified local extension; no concept seed or comp. Signature interaction is two-corner drawing with a visible first-point marker and the completed draft rectangle after the second click; keyboard users have coordinate fields and selectable zone outlines.

FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance.

Scope this increment: safe/information/sanctuary/bonus/custom presets, editable flags and messages. Advanced CSMM scenarios are not implemented. Runtime protection remains RC pending in-game smoke tests; no claim of universal invulnerability.

## Documentation outcome

This is an extension of the incumbent system evidenced by `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/index.css`, `src/components/ui.tsx`, `MapTab.tsx` and `ZoneEditor.tsx`. It adds no global visual system. PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md were absent at both repository and app roots before this work; the ordinary-extension documentation pass preserves that state rather than inventing brand context or repairing global drift.

Desktop and mobile evidence lives in `.impeccable/review/zones-desktop.png` and `zones-mobile.png`. These are synthetic, intentionally terrain-free browser fixtures, not live game evidence or shipping raster assets. The supplied finish-review disposition is `ship` with no UI fixes; the supplied detector result is `[]` and the browser harness passed. Both final captures were regenerated and opened after the fixture header charset correction; this does not establish in-game runtime protection.
